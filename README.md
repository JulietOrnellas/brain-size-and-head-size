# Brain Size and Head Size: Simple Linear Regression

This project investigates whether head size is a good predictor of brain weight using a dataset of 237 cadavers from early 20th century London. 

## Goals
- Explore and visualize the relationship between head size and brain weight
- Perform a simple linear regression analysis
- Evaluate the strength of the relationship using correlation

##  Tools and Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy
- statsmodels

## Key Findings
There is a strong positive linear correlation (r ≈ 0.8) between head size and brain weight. The resulting model allows for the prediction of brain weight from head size with reasonable accuracy.
